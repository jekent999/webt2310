        <p>Pollinators are nearly as important as the sun, soil, and water in both flowering plant reproduction,
            and in the production of most fruits and vegetables. According to the U.S. Department of
            Agriculture, about 80% of all flowering plants that feed humankind rely on pollinators! However, the
            population of all species of pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and birds are on a steady
            decline for multiple reasons such as habitat loss, and the use of pesticides. Providing a
            wildflower-rich habitat is the most significant action you can take to help support these important
            species.

        <p>Buy and plant our seeds where they can receive full sun throughout most of the day.
        Provide long-lasting blooms, and plant a variety of our seeds that flower at different times throughout the year, and plant our seeds in groups so that it will attract more pollinators. NEVER USE ANY INSECTICIDES!</p>
