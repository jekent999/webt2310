            <p>Pollinators are nearly as important as the sun, soil, and water in both flowering plant reproduction,
                and in the production of most fruits and vegetables. According to the U.S. Department of
                Agriculture, about 80% of all flowering plants that feed humankind rely on pollinators! However, the
                population of all species of pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and birds are on a steady
                decline for multiple reasons such as habitat loss, and the use of pesticides. Providing a
                wildflower-rich habitat is the most significant action you can take to help support these important
                species.
